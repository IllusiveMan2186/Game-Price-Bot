# You can run the app using Docker or launch it directly in your development environment.

## Setup for development environment:

* PostgreSQL latest version
* Zookeeper 3.9.1 or higher
* Kafka 3.6.1 or higher
* Node 18.18.0
* JDK 17 or higher
* Apache Maven 3.9.0 or higher
* Gradle 8.0.2 or higher

## Step for running in development environment:

* Launch PostgreSQL server
* Start zookeeper
* Start kafka
* Start all needed services

# Docker Setup:

## To work with GPB in Docker you need:

* Install Docker
  Docker is needed to build images and run containers.

Download and install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Enable WSL 2 integration in Docker settings.

## To work with GPB in Kubernetes you need:

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
   Since the script is written in Bash, you need a Linux environment. Install WSL2 and a distribution like Ubuntu.

Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:

```console
wsl --install
```

Restart your PC and install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store.

2. Install Docker
   Docker is needed to build images and run containers.

Download and install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Enable WSL 2 integration in Docker settings.

3. Install Minikube
   Minikube allows you to run Kubernetes locally.

Install it via Chocolatey (in PowerShell as Administrator):

```console
choco install minikube
```

Or download it from: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

4. Install kubectl
   Kubernetes CLI is required for managing the cluster.

Install via Chocolatey:

```console
choco install kubernetes-cli
```

Or download from: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

### To run GPB in Docker after installing, create a ".env" file and use the following command in root of project:

```console
docker-compose up
```

### To run GPB in Minikube after installing in terminal run:

```console
minikube start --driver=docker
```

#### Add to host file the following IP addresses:

```console
127.0.0.1    game.price.bot
127.0.0.1    api.game.price.bot
```

#### Create a ".env" file and use the following command in root of project:


```console
sh full-deploy.sh
```

#### Open minikube tunnel by the following command:

```console
minikube tunnel
```

After running the script and opening the tunnel, keep the terminal open to maintain the tunnel connection.
You can access the services via the following links:

Frontend: http://game.price.bot
Backend: http://api.game.price.bot

#### ðŸš¨ But if this links not work then run in different terminals : 
```console
kubectl port-forward svc/backend-service 8080:8080
```
```console
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend-service 3000:80
```

Then you could access services on http://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:3000
