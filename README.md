# Game Price Bot

Game Price Bot is a web application that aggregates information from multiple online stores to help users find the best video game prices.  
Users can also subscribe to price changes via email or messenger.

üí° This project is fully runnable locally using Docker or Minikube.  
No paid cloud infrastructure is required.

üìå This project is part of my learning portfolio.  
I built it to deepen my knowledge in full-stack development, distributed systems, and infrastructure automation.

  <summary>üíª Development environment </summary>

## Setup for development environment:

* PostgreSQL latest version
* Zookeeper 3.9.1 or higher
* Kafka 3.6.1 or higher
* Node 18.18.0
* JDK 17 or higher
* Apache Maven 3.9.0 or higher
* Gradle 8.0.2 or higher

## Step for running in development environment:

* Launch PostgreSQL server
* Start zookeeper
* Start kafka
* Start all needed services

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üê≥ Docker setup </summary>

## To work with GPB in Docker you need:

* Install Docker
  Docker is needed to build images and run containers.

Download and install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Enable WSL 2 integration in Docker settings.

## To run GPB in Docker after installing, create a ".env" file and use the following command in root of project:

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

or if you want to build images:
```console
docker-compose up -d --build
```


</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes  setup</summary>


## To work with GPB in Kubernetes you need:

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
   Since the script is written in Bash, you need a Linux environment. Install WSL2 and a distribution like Ubuntu.

Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:

```console
wsl --install
```

Restart your PC and install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store.

2. Install Docker
   Docker is needed to build images and run containers.

Download and install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Enable WSL 2 integration in Docker settings.

3. Install Minikube
   Minikube allows you to run Kubernetes locally.

Install it via Chocolatey (in PowerShell as Administrator):

```console
choco install minikube
```

Or download it from: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

4. Install kubectl
   Kubernetes CLI is required for managing the cluster.

Install via Chocolatey:

```console
choco install kubernetes-cli
```

Or download from: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

5. Install helm
   Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes, used to manage and install applications.

Install via Chocolatey:

```console
choco install kubernetes-helm
```

Or download from: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

## To run GPB in Minikube after installing in terminal run:

### For stable operation of all services allocate at least 5.5‚Äì8 GB of RAM to Minikube.:

```console
minikube start --driver=docker --cpus=4 --memory=8000
```

### Add to /etc/hosts (Linux/macOS) or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows):

##### On Windows:

```console
127.0.0.1 game.price.bot grafana.gpb
```

##### On Linux/macOS:

1. Use the EXTERNAL-IP of the ingress-nginx-controller service:

```console
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
```

2. Then add the IP to /etc/hosts:

```console
EXTERNAL_IP game.price.bot grafana.gpb
```

### Create a ".env" file and use the following command in root of project:


```console
bash full-deploy.sh
```

### Open minikube tunnel by the following command:

```console
minikube tunnel
```

After running the script and opening the tunnel, keep the terminal open to maintain the tunnel connection.
You can access the services via the following links:

Frontend: https://game.price.bot
Backend: https://game.price.bot/api
Grafana: https://grafana.gpb 

Login for grafana: admin , password from ".env"

* WARNING: If ingress-nginx or other pods stay in ContainerCreating or Pending state for too long, it's likely due to insufficient resources in Docker + WSL2. In that case make sure to increase memory and CPU limits via '.wslconfig'.
